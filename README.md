# GoCars!

An educational coding-puzzle game built with Godot Engine where players write **real Python code** to control traffic flow and solve increasingly complex transportation puzzles.

**For TrackTech: CSS Hackathon 2026**

---

## Project Overview

GoCars! bridges the gap between beginner-friendly coding games and real programming. Players write actual Python syntax (not visual blocks) to control vehicles, manage traffic lights, and edit road layouts in real-time. Each puzzle teaches core programming concepts: variables, conditionals, loops, and functions. The immediate feedback from live code execution makes learning intuitive and engaging.

### Core Concept

Write actual Python code to program vehicles, control traffic lights, and manage road layouts. Watch your code execute in real-time as cars navigate, stop at intersections, and reach their destinations. Learn programming fundamentals through hands-on puzzle solving.

---

## Features & Functionality

### Core Gameplay
- **Real Python Syntax** – Write valid Python code
- **Live Execution** – See cars instantly react to your code changes
- **Traffic Simulation** – Dynamic vehicle physics, collisions, and traffic light logic
- **Hearts System** – Risk-based gameplay with livesmanagement

### Interactive Features
- **Real-time Code Editor** – Write and run code without recompilation
- **Multiple Vehicles** – Handle concurrent car logic and interactions
- **Traffic Lights** – Control intersection management with conditional logic
- **Vehicle Stats Display** – Hover to see vehicle type, speed, direction, and state
- **Campaign Progression** – Save progress and unlock new levels

## Game Modes

### Campaign Mode
Three progressive level sets teaching Python fundamentals:

- **Tutorial (T1-T5)**

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

**Required:**
- **Godot Engine 4.5.1** – [Download here](https://godotengine.org/download)
- **Git** (optional, for cloning repository)
- **Python 3.8+** (optional, for running test suite)

### Step 1: Open the Project

**Option A: Using Godot Project Manager**
1. Open Godot Engine
2. Click "Open Project"
3. Navigate to `c:\Users\roman\Desktop\go-cars!`
4. Click "Open"

**Option B: Command Line**

```

### Step 2: Project Setup
1. Wait for Godot to load the project (first load takes ~30 seconds)
2. The project is already built and ready to run—no compilation needed
3. Godot automatically imports all assets

### Step 3: Run the Game

**Run in Godot Editor (with visible window):**
```bash
godot --path . --editor
# Then press Play button (F5)
```

**Run Game Directly (without editor):**
```bash
godot --path . --run
```

**Run Tests:**
```bash
./run_tests.sh
```

### Step 4: Build Executable (Optional)

To export as a standalone executable:

1. In Godot Editor: **Project → Export**
2. Click **Add Preset** and select platform:
   - **Windows Desktop** (.exe)
   - **Web** (.html)

## User Guide

### How to Play a Level

1. **Read the objective** at the top of the screen
2. **Write Python code** in the code editor (left side)
3. **Press F5 or "Run Code"** to execute
4. **Watch cars respond** in real-time
5. **Refine your code** and run again until all cars reach destinations

### Example: Level 1 (First Drive)

**Objective:** Make car1 reach its destination

**Python Code:**
```python
car.go()
```

That's it! The car moves forward automatically until it reaches the destination.

### Example: Level 4 (Red Light, Green Light)

**Objective:** Control a traffic light to let the car pass safely

**Python Code:**
```python
stoplight.set_green()
car.go()
```

### Common Commands

**Movement:**
```python
car.go()              # Start moving
car.stop()            # Stop immediately
car.turn("left")      # Turn 90° left
car.turn("right")     # Turn 90° right
car.move(3)           # Move exactly 3 tiles
```

**Sensing:**
```python
if car.front_road():        # Road ahead?
    car.go()
elif car.front_car():       # Another car ahead?
    car.stop()
```

**Traffic Lights:**
```python
if stoplight.is_red():
    car.stop()
else:
    car.go()
```

**Loops:**
```python
while not car.at_end():
    car.go()
```

## Level Editing Guide

### Create a New Level

1. **Copy a template level:**
   ```
   scenes/levelmaps/01Tutorial/01 Level 1.tscn
   ```

2. **Rename it** (e.g., `01 Level 6.tscn`)

3. **Open in Godot Editor** and customize:
   - Edit the TileMap to paint roads and parking spots
   - Set `LevelName` label for display name
   - Configure `HeartsUI/HeartCount` for starting lives (e.g., "3")
   - Position spawn and destination parking tiles

4. **Save** – the level auto-loads into the campaign

### Tileset Layout

The game uses an 18×12 grid tileset with:
- **Basic roads** (connections E/W/N/S)
- **Parking tiles** (spawn/destination groups A-D)
- **Stoplight tiles** (4-way intersections)
- **Multi-parking roads** (parking lot lanes)

---

## Known Limitations

### Current Version (Hackathon)
1. **Python Subset** – Not full Python (no classes, imports, list comprehensions)
2. **Single Player** – No multiplayer or competitive modes
3. **Fixed Difficulty** – No difficulty settings or tutorials
4. **Limited Vehicles** – Only 8 vehicle types
5. **No Persistent Save** – Progress resets on game exit (can be added)
6. **Performance** – Max ~20 simultaneous vehicles before slowdown
7. **Audio** – Placeholder sounds only (no professional OST)
8. **Mobile** – Keyboard & mouse only (no touch controls)

### Technical Limitations
- Python parser doesn't support advanced syntax (decorators, async/await)
- Vehicle AI follows pre-calculated paths (limited emergent behavior)
- Stoplight logic is basic (no adaptive traffic control)
- Road tiles must be contiguous (no floating roads)
